## Question 1. Predictive model for Green Buildings

Using the data on 7,984 commercial rental properties from the United States, the goal is to build a predictive model for rental income per square foot. To build the model we have several key features of each property such as size in square foot, leasing rate, number of stories, amenities, among others. We also have information about building's "neiborhood", weather in the area and kind of contract that the property offers. Beyond the amount of variables we have, we are specially interested in quantifying the average change in rental income per square foot  associated with green certification, holding other features of the building constant. In this dataset, 685 properties have been awarded either LEED or EnergyStar certification as a green building.

To adress this problem we use different approachs we have seen in class. The first approach is from the point of view of linear models, including model regularization techniques and stepwise selection. In the second approach we use a Lasso regression model and cross validation, to try to find a best model. Finally we implement tree models, random forest and boosting. 

### Approach #1 Linear models and stepwise selection 

To start we cleaned our database eliminating the properties that are without occupation and the entries with missing data. After that, we proceed creating a model that include variables we consider are relevant to explain the rent price. It is important to remark that we decided working with the variable that summarize green rating which takes value of 1 if the property has at least one green certifification and zero otherwise. Then, the first model we fitted is a linear one, called manual, that include most of the variables available, we mainly dropped variables that seemed to do not explain to much in our model. These variableswere property ID, precipitation days, cold and hot degree days, however we included total degrees days. After the first model, we regress a second one with the same varianles but now considering all the interactions between covariates. Having our two first models, the next step was working with the function step to look for a model that improves the AIC of the previous ones. To do that we created a null model and ran the function step to find a better model based on the scope of variables of the two originals models. After we got the new 2 models, we splitted up our sample in a train and test subsamples. To validate our models we generated out of sample RMSEs boostrapping our data.

Table 1 summarizes the information of the four linear models we built. we can see that the model with the lowest RMSE is the model 4 generated by the step function based on the all interactions model. We can also see that this model has the second lowest AIC, only improved by model 2. However, we decided to include BIC criteria too, since it penalizes the number of coefficientes included in a model. With this criteria, the model 4 is the better, considering it is a more parsimonious model than model 2. 

### Approach #2  Lasso Regression: Variable Selection and Regularization

  gb_train = gb[train_cases,]
  gb_test = gb[test_cases,]
  x_train= sparse.model.matrix(Rent ~ (.-CS_PropertyID-LEED-Energystar)^2, data=gb_train)[,-1] # do -1 to drop intercept!
  x_test= sparse.model.matrix(Rent ~ (.-CS_PropertyID-LEED-Energystar)^2, data=gb_test)[,-1]
  y=gb_train$Rent

###### CV Lasso best model ######
cvm5= cv.gamlr(x_train, y, nfold=10,  verb=TRUE)

# plot the out-of-sample deviance as a function of log lambda
# Q: what are the bars associated with each dot? 
plot(cvm5, bty="n")

## CV min deviance selection
scb.min = coef(cvm5, select="min")
lambda=log(cvm5$lambda.min)
coef.lasso=sum(scb.min!=0) 

yhat_test5 = as.numeric(predict(cvm5, x_test, select="min"))

c(rmse(gb_test$Rent,yhat_test5),lambda,coef.lasso)

}

info.lasso=colMeans(rmse_lasso)
lambda1=info.lasso[2]
coef.lasso1=info.lasso[3]

```  

The second approach is from the point of view of lasso regression. Working with the same data as the linear models, the only extraa step we needed to take before start with lasso models was the creation of sparse matrices for training and testing subsamples. The sparse matrices included the same variables of our manual linear model plus all the interactions, the last in order to have and equivalent scope of linear models. We went straight to use the cross validation function to find the best lasso model to predict rent. The cross validation function finds the lasso model tha minimized the lambda and drops all the coefficients that are close to be zero. We know when lambda is close to zero the betas found by lasso are essentially the least squares estimates. Thus, we implemented a cross validation lasso regression considering 10 folds and bostrapped again the process several times. 

**Table 2. Evaluation of Lasso Model**
```{r echo=FALSE, warning= FALSE, cache= TRUE}
info.lasso=as.data.frame(info.lasso)
colnames(info.lasso)<-c("Model 5: Lasso Model")
row.names(info.lasso) <- c("RMSE","Log Lambda",
                        "Number of coefficients")
table2=kable(info.lasso,digits=2)
table2
```

Table 2 contains the average results of the lasso cross validation. The model found has in average a log lambda of `r lambda1` and in average includes `r coef.lasso1` coefficients. However, the findings suggests that the lasso selected model does not improve the best linear model built in the previous section according with the boostrapped out of sample RSME computed. In graph 1, we show the evolution of a lasso regression for one case. We can appreciate how lasso approach found the minimum RMSE in a number of coefficients similar to the coefficients included in the best linear regression. The last reinforces that the linear model could be a good predictor of rent price.

errth = min(err1se)

# now find the largest simplest tree that beats this threshold

                  data = gb_train, mtry = 5, ntree=500)

yhat_test7 = predict(m7, gb_test)

m8 = gbm(Rent ~ .-CS_PropertyID-LEED-Energystar,
         data = gb_train,n.trees=5000, shrinkage=.05)
yhat_test8= predict(m8, gb_test, n.trees=5000)
summary(m8)
rmse.boost=rmse(gb_test$Rent,yhat_test8)

```  

As a final approach, we work with tree models, random forest and boosting. First we worked with a simple tree model to predict rent price. About trees we known that they are good to manipulate large dataset and to ignore redundant data, we know they are not the best model to prediction though. A full tree was grown on the training set, with splitting continuing until a minimum bucket size of 5 was reached. This tree was pruned, and the tree size was chosen by 10-fold cross-validation. we repeated this approach several times by data boostrapping to generate out of sample RMSEs. 
After the simple tree, we proceeded with a random forest. This method fit many large trees to bootstrap-resampled versions of the training data
by relevance. We created 500 trees by random forest including a minimum of 5 features per bucket, and later we compute the out of sample RMSE. Finally, we performed a boosting model, that mainly fits several trees to reweighted versions of the training dataset and then classifies by weighted majority relevance. We fitted 5000 trees by this method with a shrinkage factor of 0.05. 

**Table 3. Tree, Random Forest and Boosting comparative**
```{r echo=FALSE, warning= FALSE, cache= TRUE}
table3=as.data.frame(c(info.trees[1],rmse.rf,rmse.boost))
colnames(table3)<-c("RMSE")
row.names(table3) <- c("Model 6: Tree model","Model 7:Random Forest",
                           "Model 8: Boosting")
table3=kable(table3,digits=2) 
table3
```

Table 3 summarizes the RMSE of the last tree model fitted. We can see that when the simple tree model does not improve the previous models, the random forest model and the boosting model certainly outperfom all the models. The best model we have built to predict the rent price per square foot so far is the random forest model with the least out of sample RMSE. However, now we face the problem that random forest model are certainly not interpretable and we want to know the partial effect of being a green building over price. Despite of this limitation random forest models allow us to get a importance meaure of each variable in the model.It just adds up how much the error decreases every time a variable is used in a split. This information is contained in graph 2. we can observe that the most importan variable is the rent price in the cluster where our property is located, followed by size and so on.

### Concluding Remarks

With data on 7,984 commercial rental properties from the United States, we built eight models to predict the rent price per square foot. The approaches implemented varie from linear models, going throug step selection, lasso regression until to tree models, random forest and boosting. The out of sample results suggets that the model with the lowest error is the random forest model with a RMSE of `r rmse.rf`. We also were requested to find the the average change in rental income per square foot  associated with green certification. Given the barrier we have to get this kind of interpretation from a random forest model. We computed the average marginal effect of being a green building from the best linear model we fitted (Model 4). The results suggest that having a green certification leads an increasing in 1.307 dollars per square foot in rent price. This result makes sense since green building properties have positive features such as lower energy compsumption levels, variable that according with our random forest model is important to explain rent price.

## Question. 2: What causes what?

### Part A. 

Running a simple regression of crime on police will give us correlation between these two variables but it will not help us identify if one causes the other. It might be a case that crime affects police number because police numbers are apportioned by authority based on predetermined crime rates of areas. So a simple regression will be spurious and will not help us identify if higher crime leads to higher police number or vice versa.   

Even if the casual effect of police is negative but the regression might pick postive correlation due to high police in high crime areas which might lead people to infer that higher police causes higher crime rate. So a regression co-efficient always does not show what causes what. It just gives us correlation between two variables. 

### Part B. 

The researchers from UPenn came up with a technqiue called intrumental variable in which they use an exogenous shock to police numbers in district one of Washington DC. They came up with a dummy variable of High Alert for days when a high alert was issued due to potential terrorist threat and that led to a higher than usual number of police in the streets of district one. This means that they came up with a variable that only affected the number of police numbers in district one without having any affect on crime rate.

Through the increase in police number due to high alert, the researchers try to look at the casual effect of higher police on crime rate. They compare the crime rate of district one on high alert days with other adjoining districts where police number on streets remain unchanged. So district one had more police on these days as compared to other districts. 

Table 2 gives us coeffcient for high alert days which can be interpreted as a reduction of average 7.3 crimes on high alert days as compared to usual or normal days. This shows that high number of police on high alert days lead to a decrease in crime numbers. 

### Part C 

The main purpose of including this variable is to control for any change in number of public and tourists on high alert days. This approach helps in negating the assumption that crime rate decreases on high alert days because there are fewer people/ tourists on streets and so less oppurtunity for crime. The table shows that even after controlling for metro ridership, we see only a small change in coefficient for high alert day. Thus, high alert is only affecting crime through higher number of police and not through any other means. 

### Part D

From the above regression, we can see that researchers are comparing crime numbers in district one with other districts on high alert days. If only district one witness an increase in police on high alert days, then the decrease in crime rate in district one should be significantly higher than other districts. The table clearly shows this as we look at  (Highalert*District one) coefficient that shows a statistically significant decrease of average 2.8 crimes on high alert days in district one as compared to other districts of Washington that do not show any significant change. The model also includes days fixed effects, day of the week dummies, district fixed effects and district offense fixed effects to isolate the casual effect of police on crime number.  

## Question.3: Clustering and PCA - Wines

In this question we are provided with a dataset of more than six thousand different wines with their 11 chemical properties and two outcome variables quality and color. The task at hand is to employ unsupervised learning techniques and classify these wines into groups/ clusters based on color and quality. 

We start with classfication of wines based on its color. We have two colors; red and white. We plot boxplots of wine color against their chemical properties to see which properties are different across these two colors. We see that amount of chlorides, total sulfur dioxide and volatile acidity are major variables that have different distribution for red and white wines.

```{r, echo = F, cache= TRUE}
wine2= melt(wine[,-c(12,14)], id.vars = "color")
ggplot(data = wine2, aes(x=factor(color), y=value)) + geom_boxplot()+ facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free") +ggtitle("Component Analysis of Wines on color basis") 
```

### Clustering Kmeans and Kmeanspp

We run a simple kmeans clustering technique and chose centers as 2 because we already know how many groups we have to classify our data into i.e. 2 colors. The result of kmeans clustering in the table below shows that it separates wines based on its color quite successfully. Only 24+68 = 92 wines out of 6,497 wines have been misclassified by this method. The error rate is 1.416 percent.   

```{r fig.align="center", echo = F, cache= TRUE}
Z = wine[,-(12:13)]
Z = scale(Z, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
cluster1 = kmeans(Z, centers = 2, nstart = 25)
pander(table(wine$color, clust1$cluster), caption="Wine Color on Vertical axis vs Cluster group on Horizontal axis for kmeans Clustering")

```

We also plot clusters along with wine colors on a graph with two major differentiating chemical properties. White wines have more total sulfur dioxide content whereas red wines have more chlordies. 

```{r pressure, echo = F, cache= TRUE}
qplot(total.sulfur.dioxide,chlorides, data=wine, color=factor(cluster1$cluster))+ggtitle("Cluster Plot with Wine Color and Differentiating features")+ scale_color_manual(breaks = c("1", "2"), values=c("maroon", "grey"))


```

We also employ kmeans++ clustering and it gives us the same result as kmeans clustering which can be seen in the table below.

```{r, echo = F, cache= TRUE}
cluster2 = kmeanspp(Z, k=2, nstart=50)
pander(table(wine$color, cluster2$cluster), caption = "Wine Color on Vertical axis vs Cluster group on Horizontal axis for kmeans++ Clustering")
```

However when using hiearchial clustering, we do not see see clustering based on color of wines. By cutting tree at 2 we get almost all wines sorted into one cluster. Even with cutting tress at 5 or 10 levels, we dont see any balance in the distribution of wines into different clusters. It looks to be a very uneven hiearchial clustering. We try all distance measuring approaches but they all give similar results.

```{r, echo = F}
z_dist = dist(Z, method = 'euclidean')
h1 = hclust(z_dist, method ='average')
c1 = cutree(h1, 2)
pander(table(wine$color, c1), caption = "Wine Color on Vertical axis vs Cluster group on Horizontal axis for Hiearchial Clustering")
```


### PCA 
We now use PCA and transform our data accordingly. We get 11 PCAs which are plotted in scree plot below. If we look at first PCA, we see that the main contributers of variation are total sulfur dioxide,chlorides and volatile acidity which are also the main variables that differentiate red from white wines. Thus first PCA is capturing variations between red and white wines. Overall, first 6 PCAs explain 85% of total variation in our dataset of wines.     


```{r, echo = F, cache= TRUE, warning = FALSE}
Y = wine[, -c(12,13,14)]
wine_pc = prcomp(Y, scale.=TRUE)

fviz_screeplot(wine_pc, addlabels = TRUE, ylim = c(0, 35), main = "% of Variation Explained by each PCAs")

fviz_pca_var(wine_pc, col.var="contrib",
             gradient.cols = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"),
             repel = TRUE, title = "Variables Contribution in first two PCAs " )

```

We plot our graph for first two PCAs and color the points with color of wines. We can clearly see that PCA1 on the x-axis is differentiating white wines from red wines. So we can say that PCA1 is explaining color variation of wines. 


```{r, echo = F, cache= TRUE}
scores = wine_pc$x

fviz_pca_ind(wine_pc, geom.ind = "point", pointshape = 21, 
             pointsize = 2, 
             fill.ind = wine$color,
             col.ind = "black", 
             palette =  c("red", "grey"), 
             addEllipses = TRUE,
             label = "var",
             col.var = "black",
             repel = TRUE,
             legend.title = "Color") +
  ggtitle("2D PCA-plot for Wine Colors") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Now, we use our principal components to run kmeans clustering again to see if we get any better performance than simple kmeans clustering on original scaled data. With clustering on PCAs we see a further reduction in our classification error. Now we only have 37 wines misclassified which equals to an error rate of 0.5%. We can also run a logit model on PCAs but since the question asks us to use only unsupervised learning, we stuck with kmeans clustering.   

```{r, echo = F, cache= TRUE, warning = FALSE}
PCA = scale(scores, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
clustpc = kmeans(PCA, centers = 2, nstart = 50)
pander(table(wine$color, clustpc$cluster), caption = "Wine Color on Vertical axis vs Cluster group on Horizontal axis for kmeans Clustering on PCA")
```

From our results we can confidently say that kmeans clustering with PCA gives us a better result in classifying wines based on its color as compared to using clustering on original scaled data. 


### Sorting of Wine based on its Quality

We now try to sort these wines based on their quality. In the data, we have wines with quality ranging from 3 to 9 on a numerical scale. Most of these wines are 5,6 and 7 quality wines.  

```{r, echo = F, cache= TRUE}
hist(wine$quality, xlab = "Wine Quality", main = "Histogram of Wine Qualities")
```

We run the same kmeans clustering but with centers = 7 as now we need to sort wines into 7 clusters/ groups. The confusion matrix shows that there is no pattern of sorting based on quality of wine. For 6 quality wines, the alogrithm places it evenly in almost all clusters. This shows that kmeans is not picking up the differences in wine quality succesfully.


```{r, echo = F, cache= TRUE, warning = FALSE}
clust_ql= kmeans(X, centers=7, nstart=30)
pander(table(wine$quality, clust_ql$cluster), caption = "Wine Quality on Vertical axis vs Cluster group on Horizontal axis for kmeans clustering on original scaled data")
```

We then run kmeans clustering on principal components and sort data into 7 clusters. The consfusion matrix does not look much different than simple kmeans clustering. So even with PCA we are not able to sort wines based on their quality.


```{r, echo = F, cache= TRUE, warning = FALSE}
clustquality = kmeans(PCA, centers= 7, nstart = 70)
pander(table(wine$quality, clustquality$cluster), caption = "Wine Quality on Vertical axis vs Cluster group on Horizontal axis for kmeans Clustering on PCA" )
```

We try to group wines into two groups; high quality and low quality by classifying wines with quality 6 and above as high quality and the rest as low quality wines. We run kmeans clustering again but the results are not encouraging as we see a very high error rate. 

```{r, echo = F, cache= TRUE}
wine1 = mutate(wine, QL = ifelse(quality > 5, "High", "Low"))
pander(table(wine1$QL, clust1$cluster))
```

This clearly shows that the clustering and PCA techniques are not able to sort or identify wines based on its quality. It seems that our approach of euclidean distance measurement is not capturing the differenes in quality of wines. Looking at boxplots of quality against different chemical properties, we do not see much variations for chemical properties across different qualities of wines. Probably the quality of wine is not particularly linked to these 11 chemical properties and hence failure of clustering and PCA to distinguish it. 

```{r, echo = F, cache= TRUE}
wine3= melt(wine[,-c(13,14)], id.vars = "quality")
ggplot(data = wine3, aes(x=factor(quality), y=value)) + geom_boxplot()+ facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free") +ggtitle("Component Analysis of Wines for different Qualities") 
```


## Market Segmentation
### Initial Perception
```{r, echo = F}
set.seed(1)
social_marketing= read.csv('social_marketing.csv', header=TRUE)
```
The top three most shared things in our data by mean: chatter, photo sharing, health/nutrition. The chatter makes since given that this is twitter. The other two makes sense given these are people following a health/nutrition company.

```{r, echo = F}
#center and scale
X = social_marketing[,-1]
X = scale(X, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE)
#extract the centers and scales from the rescaled data for later use
mu = attr(X, "scaled:center")
sigma = attr(X, "scaled:scale")
```

Now that I have the data scaled for clustering, I'd like to figure what value of K to use so I'm going to get an elbow plot to get a ballpark for what k to use.

### Elbow Plot
```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE}
k_grid = seq(2, 20, by=1)
SSE_grid = foreach(k = k_grid, .combine='c') %do% {
  cluster_k = kmeans(X, k, nstart=50)
  cluster_k$tot.withinss
}
  plot(k_grid, SSE_grid)
```

Based on this elbow plot, k=12 is probably reasonable. This is prety arbitrary. I tried to run a gap statistic to see what kind of k that indicated was correct, but the code took too long to run. I let it run for over 24 hours and it didn't finish. So, we are going to proceed with k=12.

### Clustering
```{r}
  clust1 = kmeans(X, 12, nstart=25)
  
  clust2 = kmeanspp(X, k=12, nstart=25)
  
  clust1$tot.withinss
  clust2$tot.withinss
  clust1$betweenss
  clust2$betweenss
```
The K++ clustering had a total sum of squares between that was 658 more and a total sum of squares within that was 658 less, so cluster 2, the Kmeans++, seems to do a better job here. This is because generally we want more "distance" between clusters and less "distance" within clusters. So, lets move forward with cluster 2

### Cluster Summaries

#### Cluster 1
```{r, echo = F}

pandoc.table(clust2$center[1,]*sigma + mu) #into beauty/fashion/photosharing  
```

#### Cluster 2
```{r,echo = F}
pander(clust2$center[2,]*sigma + mu) #really into news/politics, travelling and computers #photo sharing and chatter    
```
#### Cluster 3
```{r,echo = F}
pander( clust2$center[3,]*sigma + mu) #really into news/politics, travelling and computers #photo sharing and chatter
```
#### Cluster 4
```{r,echo = F}
  pander(clust2$center[4,]*sigma + mu) #news, politics, and cars  
```
#### Cluster 5
```{r,echo = F}
pander(clust2$center[5,]*sigma + mu) #mostly chatter, but shopping and photo sharing; maybe ads 
```
#### Cluster 6
```{r,echo = F}
pander(clust2$center[6,]*sigma + mu) #outdoors, fitness, photo sharing and food/cooking maybe athletes
```
#### Cluster 7
```{r,echo = F}
pander(clust2$center[7,]*sigma + mu) #chatter, sports playing, and photo sharing  
```
#### Cluster 8
```{r,echo = F}
pander(clust2$center[8,]*sigma + mu) #Sports fans that are religious and parents 
```
#### Cluster 9
```{r,echo = F}
pander(clust2$center[9,]*sigma + mu) #adult
```
#### Cluster 10
```{r,echo = F}
pander(clust2$center[10,]*sigma + mu) #adult twitters that also have health/nutrition chatter, photo sharing, and a little politics/travel/sports fandom/current events.
```
#### Cluster 11
```{r,echo = F}
pander(clust2$center[11,]*sigma + mu) #high in dating and chatter; maybe the "gossip people" 
```
#### Cluster 12
```{r,echo = F}
pander(clust2$center[12,]*sigma + mu) #into TV/Film/Art/music also likely in college
```
#### Cluster sizes
```{r,echo = F}
  pander(clust2$size)
```
These are giving us the values for the center of the different clusters which will help us see patterns of tweeting in different market segments. I also called the cluster sizes so we can see how many people fell into each market segment/cluster


There are definitely some distinct groups that can be seen in these clusters.I will come back to these at the end of the report. Now, I'd like to look at what a PCA approach would look like for this.

### PCAs
```{r,echo = F}
  PCAs = prcomp(X, scale=TRUE)
  
  # variance plot
  fviz_screeplot(PCAs, addlabels = TRUE, ylim = c(0, 17), main = "% of Variation Explained by each PCAs")
  summary(PCAs)
  
  
```
Examining the summary, we can see that to conserve 75% of the variance, you'd have to go with 16 PCAs, which makes it seem like most of the features are relatively uncorrelated and shouldn't be compressed. I would rather go with clustering here, which won't be as destructive to the variance.

Number of people in each cluster: 
cluster 1: 451
cluster 2: 3184 
cluster 3: 341 
cluster 4: 417
cluster 5: 936
cluster 6: 732
cluster 7: 341
cluster 8: 641
cluster 9: 195
cluster 10: 49
cluster 11: 192
cluster 12: 403

Using the K++ clustering as our main descriptive tool here, we can see some distinct groups of followers for NutrientH2O:

### Cluster 6
Cluster 6 is probably athletes given that their top shared things were personal fitness, outdoors, cooking, photo sharing, and food. Athletes are useful to health and fitness brand like NutrientH2O, since they need healthy and fit people to endorse their products. This cluster also included 732 people, the third biggest cluster, so this is an important group.

### Clusters 9 and 10
Clusters 9 and 10 shared more adult content than any other category of content, so NutrientH2O should be aware of this cluster. They may want to block some of these accounts from interacting with them. From a marketing perspective, NutrientH2O probably doesn't want to be associated with adult content accounts. These are also the smallest and third smallest cluster in terms of twitter accounts, so this isn't a very big chunk of NutrientH2O's followers.

### Cluster 12
Cluster 12 was sharing a lot about TV/film/art and college, which could be useful information for NutrientH2O. Knowing that they have followers into the arts, they could try to do some targeted advertising related to movies, popular tv shoes, colleges, etc. This cluster is 403 people which is a sizable amount.

### Cluster 8
Cluster 8 was sharing a lot about sports fandom, parenting, food and religion. This could be another interesting market segment to try to appeal to through targetted marketing somehow since they are the fourth biggest market segment. NutrientH2O could try to advertise through the sports they are fans of, or through their children/ religious institution. You can see below that cluster 8 is dominating when it comes to sharing a lot about both religion and sports fandom.


```{r,echo = F}
  fviz_cluster(clust2 , data = X, choose.vars= c(7,27), geom="point")
```


### Cluster 3 and 4 

Clusters 3 and 4 are very high in politics, news, and  cluster 3 is high in automotive, computer and travelling twitter posts. This market segment seems like they are probably older, given their posts about news and politics. In the plot below, you see that many of the members with high news and politics shares are in clusters 3 and 4.

```{r,echo = F}
fviz_cluster(clust2 , data = X, choose.vars= c(8,13), geom="point")
```


### Cluster 2
Our biggest cluster was cluster 2. Cluster 2 has 3184 members, whearas the next biggest cluster only has 936. Basiaclly, cluster 2 is massive. Cluster 2 is tricky because the cluster center is below average on every category of tweet. This suggests to me that cluster 2 may be capturing the inactive/relatively inactive group of followers that NutrientH2O has. The categories they are most active in are chatter, photo sharing, current events, health and nutrition, travel, and sports fandom, in that order. The fact that cluster 2 represent a fairly inactive group on twitter can best be seen from our PCA analysis. We see all the variation vectors pointing left because the first PCA coincides with inactiveness on twitter.
```{r,echo = F}
fviz_pca_var(PCAs, col.var="contrib",
             gradient.cols = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"),
             repel = TRUE, title = "Variables Contribution in first two PCAs " )
```

### Cluster 5

This was our second biggest cluster, cluster 5, at 936 members. This group really seperates itself from the rest of the sample in the amount of photo sharing and shopping that appear on these member's accounts. This is another important market segment that has a lot going on in and around twitter so maybe Nutrient H2O needs to start sharing some photos of fashionable people using their product or vouching for their brand, etc. You can see below that cluster 5 is dominating when it comes to shopping and photo sharing posts.
```{r,echo = F}
fviz_cluster(clust2 , data = X, choose.vars= c(4,15), geom="point")
```

### Conclusion
These are just a few of the interesting market segments I saw in the clusters, but you could formulate advertising plans for more or less of the clusters here. It's up to the advertising firm which of these clusters of the NutrientH2O audience they want to utilize.
```{r,echo = F}
fviz_pca_var(PCAs,axes = c(2,3), col.var="contrib",
             gradient.cols = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"),
             repel = TRUE, title = "Variables Contribution in second two PCAs " )
```
Looking at PCA 2 and PCA 3(we took out the PCA1 because this largely represent how inactive people are), you can see the related topics, and how the vectors are pointing in similar directions when they are clustered together. This provides a nice grouping of intersts for NutrientH2O to utilize in their advertising focus. In conclusion, one market segment to focus on is interested in religion/sportsfandom/parenting/food/school/family. This market segment seems to be probably parents. A second market segment to focus on is intersted in news/computers/travel/politics. This market segment seems like it might be the generation of working, young millenials. A third market segment to focus on is interested in photo sharing/shopping/fashion/cooking/nutrition/health/chatter/beauty. This group seems more likely to be high schoolers and people more into how they look.
